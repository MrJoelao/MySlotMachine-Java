# School Exercise: Slot Machine
Simulation of a slot machine in java including GUI (school assignment)

The code was an exercise assigned to me by my computer science teacher, and since I liked the end result, I decided to upload it here. 
The code, i.e. the names of variables, objects, etc., was written in Italian, my main language, and later translated into English via chat gpt (except for some image and folder names). 
I started learning Java less than four months ago, so if there are things I could have done differently, don't beat me up :) . 
The code was written using netbeans, so some parts were automatically generated.

The code consists of a simulation of a slot machine implemented in Java, including a graphical user interface (GUI). Here is a summary of its main features and functionality:

SlotMachineGUI: This class handles the GUI of the slot machine using Java Swing. Inside there are several methods to handle the chip, lever and reel animations of the slot machine. It also handles the sound and updates the jackpot, balance and bet values.

SlotMachine: This class represents the game logic of the slot machine. It handles the random selection of numbers for the reels, determines whether winning combinations such as the jackpot, two sevens or a normal combination have been hit, and updates the player's balance and jackpot accordingly.

Resources: A number of resources are used, such as images for the slot machine, [icons](https://www.flaticon.com), sound and [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nz_BWvCF_4) files for the game sounds.
